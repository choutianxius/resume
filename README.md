| Advanced Mobile Automated Regression Testing | Paycom, LLC. | .NET, TypeScript, React.js, MySQL, Docker, GitLab | May 2024 - Aug 2024 |

- Collaboratively designed a system for executing UI regression tests on remote mobile devices, providing a unified solution to automating quality assurance tests with comprehensive control and logging for both iOS and Android.
- Developed a .NET Core backend application with the MySQL database to provide a RESTful API for managing test scripts, scheduling and dispatching testing jobs to mobile devices, and persisting test execution results.
- Implemented dependency injection and the repository pattern in the .NET Core backend project. Implemented unit tests with xUnit and Moq to achieve a full test coverage.
- Set up GitLab CI pipelines to automatically perform unit testing and linting upon merge requests.
- Built an SPA frontend for visualizing test scripts, testing jobs and results with React.js and an internal UI library.
- Containerized the .NET Core backend using Docker and integrated the frontend SPA with Docker multi-stage building.
- Awarded as one of the MVPs of the Software Development Internship program.

| Network Dissection of a DQN Agent Playing Super Mario Bros | Tsinghua Univ. | PyTorch, Deep Reinforcement Learning, OpenAI Gym, Numpy | Feb 2023 - Jun 2023 |

- Implemented the double DQN algorithm with PyTorch to train a reinforcement learning agent to beat Super Mario Bros.
- Fine-tuned a semantic segmentation model for segmenting in-game scenes to generate training dataset for the DQN agent, based on ResNet-50.
- Examined the correlation between activation of neurons in the DQN network and objects in the input scenes, in an effort to investigate the mechanism of neuron function generation.
